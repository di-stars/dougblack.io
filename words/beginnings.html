<h4>Posted on September 13th, 2013</h4>
<p>For years I've been hungrily consuming blog post after blog post in an attempt to make myself a better programmer. I've always had great respect for those among the community who had enough knowledge that they could write about something and actually have it be useful to others.</p>
<p><em>"One day, I'll write too"</em>, I always said to myself.</p>
<p><em>"Not right now, I'm too young"</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><em>"Not right now, I'm too naive</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><em>"Not right now, I'm in school"</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><em>"Not right now, I just started work</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Fuck that. I have things to say. Let's get started.</p>
